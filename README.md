1. **Create Virtual Environment**:  
   Run the following command in the terminal to create a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   py -m venv .venv
   ```

2. **Activate Virtual Environment**:    
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:  
   Install the necessary packages by running the following command in the terminal:
